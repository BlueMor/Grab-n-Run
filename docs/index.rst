Welcome to Grab'n Run documentation!
====================================

*Grab'n Run* (aka **GNR**) is a **simple** and **effective** Java Library that you can add to your Android projects to secure *dynamic class loading* operations.

For a **quick start** on how to include the library and how to use it in your projects give a look at :doc:`tutorial`.

For a brief explanation on the **issue** of *insecure dynamic class loading* and on Grab'n Run purpose check the :doc:`security` section.

A concise **example** of use of the library is provided into an Android toy-application `here <https://github.com/lukeFalsina/Grab-n-Run/tree/master/example>`_. A *full explanation* of key extracts of this code is given into the :doc:`example` section.

For those willing for more **technicalities** and **advanced features** implemented in *Grab'n Run*, the section on :doc:`complementary` is a *must-read*. This part of the documentation can also be used for **reference** as it presents how to handle properly some **tricky situations** that may occur while using *GNR*.

Finally for a description on Grab'n Run **API** in *JavaDoc* style please refer to the `API documentation <https://rawgit.com/lukeFalsina/Grab-n-Run/master/docs/javaDoc/index.html>`_.

Quick start and tutorial
========================

In this section you will learn how to retrieve and include Grab'n Run library into your project (either by using Android Development Tool or Android Studio).
After this setup a brief tutorial will explain how to use different classes
in the library to **secure** the *dynamic code loading operations*.

Since this section is **introductory** and more descriptive, it should be read by those who are not familiar with this library or more in general with *class loading* in Android. On the other hand the :doc:`api` section provides a more complete and detailed view on Grab'n Run library and its insights, while :doc:`example` shows a simple case of use of the concepts introduced here.
